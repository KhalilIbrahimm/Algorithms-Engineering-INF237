# INF237 - Algorithms Engineering (UiB)

This repository contains problem solutions from **INF237 - Algorithms Engineering** at the University of Bergen (UiB). The problems are taken from **Kattis** and focus on different algorithmic techniques, programming paradigms, and data structures.

Each week introduces a new topic, ranging from fundamental concepts like sorting and graphs to more advanced topics like dynamic programming and flow networks. 

## Weekly Topics
| Week | Topic |
|------|------|
| 1 | Competitive Programming |
| 2 | Graphs |
| 3 | Sliding, Searching, and Sorting |
| 4 | Dynamic Programming |
| 5 | Graphs 2 |
| 6 | Segment Trees |
| 7 | Geometry |
| 8 | Exponential Time Algorithms |
| 9 | Dynamic Programming 2 |
| 10 | Flow Networks |
| 11 | Geometry 2 |
| 12 | Strings |
| 13 | Numbers |

Each week's folder contains a `README.md` with links to the relevant Kattis problems.
